                    This project was planned as 
                    a term paper on the topic 
                    "Income and Expenses System" based on one of the 
                    frameworks. 
                    The goal was to test our capabilities and build 
                    a functionally progressive product that 
                    would dynamically accept data, as well as 
                    dynamically process it and bring it to an 
                    up-to-date state.
